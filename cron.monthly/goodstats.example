# This reminds users of having subscribed to my Goodreads services even when 
# there were no news for a long time:
#
#   1. Answers doubts "I got no mails. Does it work?"
#   2. The check-history might show worth to user
#   3. Annoys users who have received nothing or are no longer interested 
#        -> unsubscribe -> free resources
