### Note:

You can `^C`-break the script and continue later without having to re-read all
online sources again, as reading from Goodreads.com is very time consuming.
The script internally uses a **file-cache** which is busted after 21 days
and saves to /tmp/FileCache/.

"In common with you" means that your match has at least one of _your_
books in his shelves. So this program checks all of _your_ books and counts 
how often it saw a Goodreads member commenting on any of them: reviews, ratings,
shelf additions etc.


## Observations and serious limitations

- maximum of 300 members per book; this means there is a huge number of readers 
  not considered in our statistics, but 300 is better than nothing; everything else
  requires full access to the Goodreads database or indexing millions of books from
  the outside which would take forever
- there are members with 94.857 ratings, likely bots
- lists members with private accounts (reviews still readable)
- 50% similarity is unrealistic (why?), 3% minimum got me 10 of 31.398 members (299 books),
  with 5 members actually worth investigating
- your Goodreads account must be viewable by 
  ["anyone (including search engines)"](https://www.goodreads.com/user/edit?tab=settings) 
  which is the default
- program is slow (throttled and I have no botnet with numerous IP addresses) but 
  [good enough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_good_enough) since you run it 4x a year
