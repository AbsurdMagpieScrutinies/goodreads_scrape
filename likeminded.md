### Note:

You can break the process with <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> and continue later without having to re-read all
online sources again, as reading from Goodreads.com is very time consuming.
The script internally uses a **file-cache** which is busted after 21 days
and saves to /tmp/FileCache/.



## Observations and serious limitations

- maximum of 300 members per book; this means there is a huge number of readers 
  not considered in our statistics, but 300 is better than nothing; everything else
  requires full access to the Goodreads database or indexing millions of members 
  and books from the outside which would take forever (throttled access)
- there are members with 94.857 ratings, likely bots
- lists members with private accounts (reviews still readable)
- your Goodreads account must be viewable by 
  ["anyone (including search engines)"](https://www.goodreads.com/user/edit?tab=settings) 
  which is the default
- slow but good enough since you run it 4x a year
- "_...most number of shared books would be a list of children's books_"â€”`likeminded.pl` has a shelf parameter (sort of selection)

**First version compared books, not authors:**
- turned out to be too narrow in order to produce satisfying results
- given 299 books and a minimum of 9 _common_ books (3% similarity), 
  I've got 10 of 31.398 members,
  with 5 members actually worth investigating, 
  and only 1 member already on my hand-curated list of 137 followees
- a minimum of 6 common books (2%) listed 43 members, more or less interesting
- we learn: book combinations tend to become unique quickly
- the new authors-version takes longer but yields better results, e.g.,
  more matches with my hand-curated followees list
