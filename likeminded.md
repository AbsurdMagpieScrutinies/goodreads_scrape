**Note:**

You can break the process with <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> and continue later
without having to re-read all online sources again, as reading from
Goodreads.com is very time consuming.  The script internally uses a
**file-cache** which is busted after 31 days and saves to /tmp/FileCache/.



## Observations and limitations

**Latest version:**
- loading data could take a month with too many books: Prefer a separate "best-of" shelf
  (with 100 representative books) over the "All" or "Read" shelves.
  You can specify multiple shelves in a single run (--shelf parameter).
- the more popular your literature, the longer the program's runtime and the 
  more questionable its results (too generic, many unseen reviewers) - or: 
  add good but rare books to your "best-of" shelf
- make sure you have some _Gigabytes_ of free diskspace for /tmp/
- there's no way to load _all_ reviews of a book, but the program tries different 
  things to get as many reviews as possible.
  This means there is a number of readers not considered in our statistics,
  and we cannot randomize in a way which would produce samples of similar size.
  Although, we don't get _all_ members (for books with ten of thousand
  reviews), the final report still contains _enough_ members who read the 
  same N authors
- there are members with 94.857 ratings, likely bots
- lists members with private accounts
- slow but good enough since you run it 4x a year
- your Goodreads account must be viewable by 
  ["anyone (including search engines)"](https://www.goodreads.com/user/edit?tab=settings) 
  which is the default (alternatively try --cookie parameter)
- "_...most number of shared books would be a list of children's books_"â€”`likeminded.pl` has a shelf parameter (sort of selection)

**First version compared books, not authors:**
- turned out to be too narrow in order to produce satisfying results
- given 299 books and a minimum of 9 _common_ books (3% similarity), 
  I've got 10 of 31.398 members,
  with 5 members actually worth investigating, 
  and only 1 member already on my hand-curated list of 137 followees
- a minimum of 6 common books (2%) listed 43 members, more or less interesting
- we learn: book combinations tend to become unique quickly
- combinations of same books are more rare than combinations of same authors, while latter still satisfies the 'same taste' condition (assumption with books is that likeminded people have the same exposure to the same books, but that's questionable and comparing the _authors_ relaxes or widens this assumption)
- the new authors-version takes longer but yields better results, e.g.,
  more matches with my hand-curated followees list
