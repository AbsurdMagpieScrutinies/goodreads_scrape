## Finding people based on the books they've read

From the _Goodreads Feedback_ forum, [Mehran](https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/19397936-finding-people-based-on-the-books-they-ve-read) 
> Is there a way to search for people who have read books X, Y, and Z? Or maybe
> a way for you to find people who have many books in common with you, without
> going through people manually? If such features don't exist, Goodreads should
> definitely add them. They can provoke many conversations among people who have
> similar tastes in books.

### Note:

You can `^C`-break the script and continue later without having to re-read all
online sources again, as reading from Goodreads.com is very time consuming.
The script internally uses a **file-cache** which is busted after 21 days
and saves to /tmp/FileCache/.



## Observations and limitations

- maximum of 300 members per book; this means there is a huge number of readers 
  not considered in our statistics, but 300 is better than nothing
- there are members with 94.857 ratings, likely bots
- lists members with private accounts (reviews still readable)
- 50% similarity is unrealistic (why?), 3% got me 10 members for 299 books,
  with 5 members actually worth investigating
- your Goodreads account needs to be public
