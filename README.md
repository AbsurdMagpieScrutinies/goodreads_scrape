# Andr√©'s Goodreads Toolbox

[Goodreads.com](http://www.goodreads.com/) is the world largest book community 
and a tools provider for web-based (home-)library management.



## [amz-tradein.pl](amz-tradein.md)

This script fetched Amazon Trade-In prices for all books in a Goodreads.com
shelf ("resales" or "donations"). It automated regular manual bid-checking for 
hundreds of books, discovering sales opportunities. Amazon stopped its buyback 
program in 2015.

## [recentrated.pl](recentrated.md)

Checks all the books in a Goodreads.com shelf for new ratings and notifies you
via e-mail. This helps discover new users with quality libraries.
You can [subscribe there](https://andre-st.github.io/goodreads/) if you don't
want to install anything.
It's a poor man's solution to the "follow book" feature request in the Goodreads forums.

## [friendrated.pl](friendrated.md)

Prints all books which have been rated 4 or 5 stars by 3 or more persons you
follow (including friends). It's a poor man's solution to the "books common
among the people I follow" feature request in the Goodreads forums.

### www/

Static webpages that I use to offer [this software as a service](https://andre-st.github.io/goodreads/) 
to people who don't know Linux etc. You probably won't need this directory.

- [A few things](GOODTIPS.md) that improved my Goodreads experience: settings, browser extensions etc.

    

## modest remark

These programs are never as performant and usable as native Goodreads solutions
with direct _unthrottled_ access to their databases and seamless integration 
with their user interface etc.
